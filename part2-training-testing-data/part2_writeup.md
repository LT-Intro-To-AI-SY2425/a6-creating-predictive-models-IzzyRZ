# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson? 
I actually got a lower r^2 value when I ran this, only  0.4697173430602597

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model? The r^2 coefficient tells me that this model's predictions will be somewhat unreliable.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure. The model definitely follows a rough trend of how blood pressure increases with age, and while it may not be exact, it did get very close to the three testing points chosen. I would say it is somewhat accurate, but definitely needs improvement.
